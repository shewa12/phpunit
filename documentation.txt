#INSTALLING COMPOSER AUTOLOAD & PHPUNIT

first install composer autoload & then php unit 

composer dump command: composer dump-autoload
phpunit installing command: composer require --dev phpunit/phpunit ^9.5

#PHPUNIT COMMAND WILL BE AVAILABLE FROM ROOT_DIRECTORY/VENDOR/BIN PHPUNIT

NOTE: When running phpunit command i was having following issue:

/usr/bin/php declares an invalid value for PHP_VERSION.
This breaks fundamental functionality such as version_compare().
Please use a different PHP interpreter.

SOLUTION: 
I had followed these commands for solution
$ brew install php@7.4
$ echo ‘export PATH=”/usr/local/opt/php@7.4/bin:$PATH”‘ >> ~/.bash_profile
$ echo ‘export PATH=”/usr/local/opt/php@7.4/sbin:$PATH”‘ >> ~/.bash_profile

#Every test method should be prefixed by test

Ex: testDivision 

#TO SHOW COLOR ON THE OUTPUT TEXT NEED TO USE BELOW PARAM:

Ex: phpunit test.php --color

#TO GET MORE DETAILS ABOUT TEST CAN BE USED BELOW PARAM:

--testdox OR -v

#@covers ANNOTATIONS SHOULD BE USED BEFORE CLASS OR BEFORE METHOD OTHERWISE TEST WILL BE COUNTED AS RISKY

Ex: 
/**
 *@covers ClassName
*/
class ClassName {}

/**
 *@covers methodName
*/
function methodName() {}

#<testsuite></testsuite> TEST SUITE IS USED FOR NAMING EACH TEST SUITE AND USE WITH SUITE NAME INSTEAD OF USING FULL PATH

Ex: 
<testsuites>
    <testsuite name="abc">
        <directory>test/abc.php</directory>
    </testsuite>
    <testsuite name="xyz">
        <directory>test/xyz.php</directory>
    </testsuite>
</testsuites>

NAME ATTRIBUTE ON TESTSUITE IS REQUIRED

Command Ex: phpunit --testsuite SUITE_NAME
